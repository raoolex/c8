              This blog is your full guide – like a documentary unpacked in words – on starting a startup or side hustle. We'll dive deep into doing it without any upfront cash (yep, zero investment) and with some investment to scale faster. At the end, we'll compare and contrast the two paths. I'll keep it simple, using easy words anyone can understand, just like chatting with a friend over coffee.

                <span className="font-bold">The inspiration?</span> That cool paragraph on digital products – things like eBooks, templates, or photos you create once and sell forever without extra costs. No shipping headaches, just pure profit. A $10 eBook sold 200 times? That's $2,000 easy. Platforms like Etsy or Gumroad make it a breeze. We'll build on that, turning it into a step-by-step blueprint for earning big.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                A side hustle lets you test ideas without quitting your job, earning extra cash on weekends. Startups aim for full-time growth, like turning a hobby into a company. Both can lead to big earnings if done right.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                They work because the world needs solutions – from apps to templates. No fancy degree needed; just hustle and smarts. Earning potential? Side hustles can hit $1,000/month; startups millions with scaling.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                This path beats traditional jobs by offering flexibility and uncapped income. Think: Create once, sell forever, like that $10 eBook example.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Understanding Investment in Business</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Investment means putting money in to start or grow. Without it, you use free tools and time. With it, you buy ads or tools for speed.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                No-investment relies on sweat equity – your effort. Invested paths use cash for leverage, like hiring help. Both can succeed, but paths differ.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                We'll explore both, showing how digital products fit perfectly in no-investment, but can scale with money.
